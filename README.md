# Beer Can Racer #

##### Beer Can Racer is the blueprint for an online commuity of sailors, with the intention of putting yacht skippers in touch with potential crew. The idea is that if you, as a skipper, need crew, then you can post a race to the app and any other user can RSVP for that race while there are available spaces. If you are just looking to get some more experience, you can join a race and sail away.
